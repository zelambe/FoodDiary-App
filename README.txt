In this file you should include:

Any information you think we should know about your submission
* Is there anything that doesn't work? Why?
* Is there anything that you did that you feel might be unclear? Explain it here.


My app was working a few moments ago but there might be a problem with my emulator or my code (i'm not sure which)
If it doesnt build, I'm just letting you know ahead of time. If you look through my code, youll see that it looks like it should work.
I also didnt have time to sanitize input on my addactivity screen


A description of the creative portion of the assignment
* Describe your feature
* Why did you choose this feature?
* How did you implement it?

I didnt implement one. I tried to delete items from the list but it wasnt working so i took it out
